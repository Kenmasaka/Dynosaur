# Dynosaur
A cool bot, made with JavaScript and Discord.js, but more importantly, with lots of love.

## Invite me

You can invite me using [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=817782749213360219&scope=bot&permissions=8). You can also get support [here](https://discord.gg/pdjyt4W7gu).

## What can I do?

With more than 20 commands, I can do lots of things, from creating channels, to asking questions to the magic 8ball, from making ticket channels to deleting potential ads from non-admin members. 
Plus, I get updates very often, so if you're bored of these commands, always remember that a new update will be coming soon.

## FAQ

Any questions? They'll be answered here :

### How is the bot made?

I am made with discord.js, and you can find all my command files in my repository. 

### The bot gets offline and online suddenly, why?

As I am is hosted on my creator's personal computer, I am never online 24/7. If I get to 50 servers, I might become online 24/7...
Sometimes, I am suddenly offline and then back online, and this usually means that an update is near, and that my creator's testing potential future updates...

### Can I get access to updates before they are announced?

For now, you can check the projects section of my repository, and only my creator's best friends can have access to them. This is for two reasons :

- My updates get usually online immediately after all the new commands are working properly. 
- Because of this, before updates, potential new commands don't fully work. 

## Thanks

- Kenmasaka : Hey, what are you doing here, Dynosaur? I thought you were in my computer! 
- I just wanted to write great stuff about me so people invite me in their servers... \n
- The text in all is great, but you have forgotten something...

I wanted to personally thank all my friends that helped me constantly at making Dynosaur better and better. They supported me, and gave amazing ideas.

## Inspired by...

Dynosaur has been heavily inspired by other bots like MEE6, and I wanted to give it and its team a shoutout, as their bot is much more complete than mine. So don't forget that if some stuff is missing with my bot, MEE6 is the best choice! :)
